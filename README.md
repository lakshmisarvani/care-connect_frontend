# Online Donation

The Online Donation Management System is designed to streamline and manage the donation process between donors and recipients in need. This system enables users to register, authenticate, and contribute essential items or funds, while recipients can raise requests based on their needs.

## Available Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.


The backend API services for this project are implemented using Spring Boot. You can find the complete backend source code here:
https://github.com/lakshmisarvani/springboot_care-connect.git

This backend handles:
User and donor authentication
Donation request management
RESTful APIs for frontend integration
Database interaction with CRUD operations

Please ensure the backend is running locally or deployed before using the frontend application.
